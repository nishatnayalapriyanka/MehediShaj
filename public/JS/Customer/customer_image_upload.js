/*
1. function previewImage(input) {: This line declares a function named previewImage that takes an input parameter.

2. var preview = document.getElementById('preview');: This line selects an HTML element with the ID 'preview' using document.getElementById and assigns it to the variable preview. This element is presumably an <img> tag where the preview of the selected image will be displayed.

3. if (input.files && input.files[0]) {: This line checks whether the input element (input) has files selected (input.files) and ensures that the first file (input.files[0]) exists.

4. var file = input.files[0];: This line assigns the first file selected in the input element to the variable file.

5. var reader = new FileReader();: This line creates a new instance of FileReader, which helps read the contents of a file asynchronously.

6. reader.onload = function (e) { ... };: This line sets up an event handler that will be triggered when the FileReader has finished reading the file. It defines what to do with the file's content once it's loaded.

7. preview.src = e.target.result;: Inside the event handler, this line sets the src attribute of the preview element (likely an <img> tag) to the result obtained after reading the file as a data URL. This effectively displays the selected image in the designated <img> tag.

8. reader.readAsDataURL(file);: This line starts reading the contents of the file as a data URL (base64-encoded string) using the readAsDataURL method of the FileReader. This action triggers the loading of the file content asynchronously.

The purpose of this function is to take an input element that allows file selection (e.g., <input type="file">) and display a preview of the selected image in an HTML element with the ID 'preview'.
